## API Endpoints

- `POST /api/chat` - Send a message to the chatbot
- `GET /api/health` - Check server status

## Customization

### Changing the AI Model

In `server.js`, you can modify the OpenAI model by changing the `model` parameter:

```javascript
const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4", // Change to gpt-4 for more advanced responses
  // ... other parameters
});
```

### Adjusting Response Parameters

You can customize the AI responses by modifying these parameters in `server.js`:

- `max_tokens`: Maximum length of the response (default: 150)
- `temperature`: Controls randomness (0.0 = deterministic, 1.0 = very random)
- `system` message: Defines the AI's personality and behavior

### Styling Customization

The chatbot's appearance can be customized by editing `public/styles.css`. The design uses CSS custom properties and modern CSS features.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Cannot connect to server" error**
   - Make sure the Node.js server is running
   - Check if port 3000 is available
   - Verify the server started without errors

2. **"Failed to get response from OpenAI" error**
   - Verify your OpenAI API key is correct
   - Check if you have sufficient API credits
   - Ensure your API key has the necessary permissions

3. **CORS errors**
   - The server is configured with CORS enabled
   - If issues persist, check browser console for specific error messages

### Getting Help

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the browser's developer console for error messages
2. Verify your OpenAI API key is valid and has credits
3. Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly
4. Check that the server is running on the correct port

## Security Notes

- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- Keep your OpenAI API key secure and private
- Consider implementing rate limiting for production use
- Use HTTPS in production environments
